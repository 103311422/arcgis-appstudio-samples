## Creating a simple basemap picker for your apps in AppStudio using QML and JavaScript

A basemap is an essential mapping component for providing relativity and context to spatial data displayed on a web map.  Providing users the option to select from a variety of basemaps can offer a more refined finish and options to end users.  The short video below demonstrates a simple basemap picker written in QML and JavaScript with AppStudio for ArcGIS.
