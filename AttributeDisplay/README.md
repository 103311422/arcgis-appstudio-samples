## Displaying attributes info popup in your apps built with AppStudio using QML and JavaScript

Sample AppStudio app with a attribute info popup that displays when a feature is clicked (or tapped) on the map.  This sample makes it easy to change attribute display names, choose which attributes to hide, re-order fields, and format values as dates, hyperlinks, numbers with a specified number of decimal places and/or a thousands separator, and add a prefix or suffix, such as a dollar sign, a percentage sign, or some other set of characters.  The short video below demonstrates how the sample works.
