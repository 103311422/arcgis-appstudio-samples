To consume in ArcGIS Runtime, first create a WmtsService by passing in the URL to the WMTS service.  Load the WmtsService by calling load, and wait for the service to load by connecting to the loadStatusChanged signal.  Once the service loads, obtain the WmtsLayerServiceInfo and the list of WmtsLayerInfo from the loaded WmtsService.  In this particular sample, the first layer is obtained from the list of WmtsLayerInfo, and that Layer's ID is retrieved.  Finally, a WmtsLayer is created by setting the URL and the Layer ID that was obtained in the previous step.  A basemap is created from the WmtsLayer, and this Basemap is added to a new Map       </p>\n<p style='-qt-paragraph-type:empty; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;'><br /></p>\n<p style=' margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;'><a href='http://geonet.esri.com/groups/appstudio/blog/2016/12/06/how-to-describe-our-resources-in-terms-of-difficulty-complexity-and-time-to-digest'><span style=' text-decoration: underline; color:#0000ff;'>Resource Level:</span></a>üçåüçå</p>",
